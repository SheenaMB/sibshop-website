# sibshop-website
Updating the “Sibling Support Project” Organization website:

In this project our team will be taking an outdated website and updating it so that it is:

	- Aesthetically pleasing.
	- Easy to navigate through information as well as resources.
	- Organized more efficiently (libraries all together, workshop info together).

We will also be adding components using MySQL and Sequelize ORM to:

	- Create a database to organize resources/books/articles and display them as requested.
	- Create a database for community members to be able to 

Currently, we will focus on the updates listed above, but here are future directions that this website would also use MySQL: 
Phase 1: Build a database of all resources  - current goal.
Phase 2: Having the ability for community members to add their preferences.
Phase 3: Creating a commenting system where members could comment on various resources. That would be saved in another table and it would be cross compared in a join with the resources table. 
Phase 4: Create two views, one for a regular user, the other, administrative.
*Ability to create, delete, and update the resources database.
*Ability to update the retrieve/reset password function as it currently has to go through an administrator.
*Ability to update workshops/training dates


We will condense the website into 4 main pages:
Index/About
Workshops/Trainings
Library
Community

To begin, will be sketching the new site using Balsamic in order to strategize and visualize organizing the information effectively.
